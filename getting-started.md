## Getting started with Image+
-------------------------------


### Creating a new TV
------------------------
Once *Image+* is installed, you can create TVs in the normal way,
but instead of setting the **TV Input Type** to *Image*,
select *Image+* instead.

For most use cases, you should also set the **TV Output Type**
to *Image+*. This allows you to control how the image is output
into a page.


### Using the cropping tool
-----------------------------
When using an *Image+* TV, you select the image you want to use
in exactly the same way as with a normal Image TV. Once selected,
however, you now get the option to choose what area of the image
to use. This means that you can upload a single image, and re-use
it in several places at several different sizes around the site.

Click on the 'Crop Image' button, and a window will appear showing
the image you have chosen, and the current cropping area.

Drag the corners of the dotted box to change the crop area to be used.
If the TV was configured with size constraints, the crop area will be
restricted to match the configured size ratio.
