### Installing from MODX Extras Repository
-------------------------------------------
Search for Image+ in the Package Manager of a MODX installation, then install it in the same way you would install other extras.

### Manual installation
------------------------
If you cannot access the MODX Extras Repository from your MODX installation, you can also manually install Image+.

* Download the transport package installer from
  [here](http://modx.com/extras/package/imageplustvinput)
  (or [build it from source](building-from-source.html))
* Upload the zip file to your MODX installation's `core/packages`
  folder.
* In the MODX Manager, navigate to the Package Manager page, and
  select 'Search locally for packages' from the dropdown button.
* Image+ should now show up in the list of available packages.
  Click the corresponding green 'Install' button and follow instructions to complete the installation.
